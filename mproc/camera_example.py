"""
Simple example showing how to combine multiprocessing (camera reader)
with a thread (keyboard button poller) and render frames in the main process.

Usage (Windows):
  python mproc/camera_example.py

Controls:
  - Press 'e' in the console to toggle camera pause/resume
  - Press 'q' in the console to quit the program

Notes:
  - The camera runs in a separate process to avoid GIL issues and allow
    heavy processing without blocking the main loop.
  - The button poller runs as a thread in the main process and uses
    msvcrt.kbhit()/getwch() on Windows to do non-blocking key reads.
  - Frames are transferred over a multiprocessing.Queue (simple/pickle-based).
    For high-throughput production use shared_memory, zmq, or a ring buffer.
